## Applying SOLID Principles (Bank ATM)

Your task for this assignment is add enhancements to an ATM simulator. The [BankAtm][bankatm-file] is at the center of the model, allowing us to add one or more `CheckingAccount` instances and make withdrawals or deposits via cash or check. You will need to implement at least two of the following functional enhancements to the `BankAtm` class WITHOUT adding a new method. Note that you can update existing methods, however.

### Functional Requirements

* We want to support a `SavingsAccount` that works just like the `CheckingAccount`, but doesn't allow you to write checks against the account.
* We want the `BankAtm` class to support the concept of a `BusinessCheckingAccount`. A business account requires that at least one of the owners is a business.
* In addition to supporting checks and cash, we also want to support the concept of another monetary instrument called a `MoneyOrder`. Unlike a `Check`, a `MoneyOrder` withdraws funds from a source account immediately on creation for the purposes of this simulation..
* For traceability, all of the transactions in the `BankAtm` class should logged. Create an `AuditLog` class that keeps a record of all debits and credits to any account and integrate it with the `BankAtm` class. 
* ~~For the `depositFunds` method that accepts a cash amount, we'd like the ability to deposit funds in a variety of currencies. Add a parameter that accepts a currency type and a new object that encapsulates the currency converter logic for converting a cash amount to the account currency type.~~

### Technical Requirements

* You must integrate new features into the `BankAtm` without adding a new public method. Existing public methods may be modified without breaking existing functionality.
* You must update the `BankAtm` tests and may modify or add other applicable tests.
* Feel free to add the minimal number of classes, interfaces, or abstract classes needed to fulfill each requirement.
* You must update existing javadocs and may add new documentation for new types and methods you introduce.
